# Why this Workshop?

Excel is a powerful tool, but as data gets bigger, you may need more tools.

- How do you analyze data that won't open up in Excel because the file is too large?
- How do you work with data that are stored in different Excel files?
- How do you replicate your work if your boss/colleague sends you new files?
- Etc.

---

# Learning Outcomes

- Differentiate tidy data from clean data
- Explain the importance of tidy data and clean data in data analysis
- Identify errors in the data and propose possible solutions to address these errors
- Create report-quality graphs and tables

# Why Care about Tidy Data?

- Tidy data arranges values so that the relationships in the data parallel the structure of the data frame. 
- R functions and packages are optimized to work with tidy data

# Tidy Data

- Are both data frames tidy? Why or why not?

# Tidy Data

- Are both data frames tidy? Why or why not?
- Most data you will work with in your Graduating Project (GPs) and in life will **not be tidy**

---

# Tidy Data

- Are both data frames tidy? Why or why not?
- Most data you will work with in your Graduating Project (GPs) and in life will **not be tidy**
  - Why? Perhaps that data structure is more conducive for data entry, or that format is the convention in that field.

# Tidy Data

- Are both data frames tidy? Why or why not?
- Most data you will work with in your Graduating Project (GPs) and in life will **not be tidy**
  - Why? Perhaps that data structure is more conducive for data entry, or that format is the convention in that field. 
- Be prepared to spend more time tidying your data than doing your analysis for your GP. 
  - The earlier you get your data into a tidy format, the more time you can spend answering interesting questions about your data. 

---

# Inspecting the Data

- Data is *NOT TIDY* for the `ref_table` data
  - Remember that World Development Indicators file Mike showed in FRE526 last Thursday? -> "One variable one column"
- In Excel, this sheet contains 3 separate tables. But R reads it as one big table with empty columns. 
  - Format makes it easy for data entry in Excel but not conducive for data analysis. 

![](pics/ref_table.gif)

- What can we do to tidy this Reference sheet?

---

# Reload Reference Sheet

- We add the argument `range =` to tell R the cell range to import for each table 
- Since we used `Reference!A3:E10`, we don't have to indicate `sheet = 2` anymore. 

```{r reload_ref_tables}
prod_codes <- read_excel(here("data", "Crepe & Mocca Database workshop PRE.xlsx"), 
                         range = "Reference!A3:E10")

serv_codes <- read_excel(here("data", "Crepe & Mocca Database workshop PRE.xlsx"),
                         range = "Reference!G3:H5")

pay_codes <- read_excel(here("data", "Crepe & Mocca Database workshop PRE.xlsx"), 
                         range = "Reference!J3:k8") 
```

---

# Variable Names

- Do you think that the variable names are conducive for analysis?

```{r colnames}
names(transaction)
names(ref_table)
```

---

# Renaming Variables

In the R bootcamp, we learned two ways to rename variable names

- Method 1
```{r rename_vars1, eval = F}
names(prod_codes)[4] <- "old_price"
names(prod_codes)[5] <- "new_price"
```

- Method 2
```{r rename_vars2, eval = F}
prod_codes <- prod_codes %>%
  rename(old_price = "Price per ea\r\neff. Apr 9, 2015") %>%
  rename(new_price = "Price per ea\r\neff. Oct 10, 2017")
```

---

# Renaming Variables

- There is a package called [`{janitor}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/janitor.html) that has a very useful `clean_names()` function. 

```{r changenames}
names(prod_codes)

prod_codes <- clean_names(prod_codes)

names(prod_codes)
```

---

# Renaming Variables 

- Let's use the `clean_names()` function on the other data frames too.

```{r changeotherdfnames}
transaction <- clean_names(transaction)
pay_codes <- clean_names(pay_codes)
prod_codes <- clean_names(prod_codes)
serv_codes <- clean_names(serv_codes)
```

- How do your variable names look like now?

---

# Tidy Data versus Clean Data

- Each data frame is now in the tidy format. But can the data be trusted? 
  - Let's look at the `transaction` data frame. 
- What were some data validation steps you did in Janelle's workshop? 

---

# Understanding your data

```{r data_exp}
dim(transaction)
glimpse(transaction)

# skimr::skim(transaction)
```

---

# "Filter" the Variables

- One of the first steps you did in the Excel workshop was to use the filter function

```{r data_exp2}
table(year(transaction$date))
table(month(transaction$date))

table(transaction$service_id)
```

---

# Data Checks - Duplicates

- We can use the [`get.dupes()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/janitor/versions/2.1.0/topics/get_dupes) function from the `{janitor}` package

```{r duplicates}
duplicates <- transaction %>% 
  get_dupes(invoice_id)

head(duplicates)
```

---

# Data Checks - Duplicates

- Can do additional checks to detect patterns in duplicated `invoice_id`


```{r duplicates_analyze}
table(year(duplicates$date))
table(month(duplicates$date))
```

- What would be a good next step?

---

# Data Checks - GST

- Check if Subtotal + GST = Total

```{r datacheck}
summary(transaction$subtotal + transaction$gst == transaction$total)
table(transaction$date[transaction$subtotal + transaction$gst != transaction$total])
table(transaction$payment_type[transaction$subtotal + transaction$gst != transaction$total])
table(transaction$service_id[transaction$subtotal + transaction$gst != transaction$total])
table(transaction$product_id[transaction$subtotal + transaction$gst != transaction$total])
# transaction %>% 
#   filter(subtotal + gst != total)
```


# Data Checks - GST

- Let's create 2 new variables called `gst_corrected` and `total_corrected`

```{r correcting}
transaction <- transaction %>%
  mutate(gst_corrected = subtotal * 0.05,
         total_corrected = subtotal + gst_corrected) 

summary(transaction$subtotal + transaction$gst_corrected == transaction$total_corrected)
```

---

# Data Checks - New Prices

- Check if new prices were implemented on October 10, 2017

```{r datacheck2}
transaction <- transaction %>%
  mutate(unit_price = subtotal / units) %>%
  mutate(effective_date = case_when(date > "2017-10-10" ~ 1, 
                                    TRUE ~ 0))

max(transaction$date[transaction$effective_date == 0])
min(transaction$date[transaction$effective_date == 1])
```

---

# Data Checks - New Prices

- Check if new prices were implemented on October 10, 2017

```{r datacheck3, message = FALSE}
price_check <- transaction %>%
  group_by(product_id, effective_date) %>%
  summarize(unit_price = round(mean(unit_price),2))  %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = effective_date,
              values_from = unit_price) %>%
  rename("after_oct_10" = `1`,
         "before_oct_10" = `0`) %>%
  full_join(prod_codes %>% select(-category), by = c("product_id"))
```

---

# Data Checks - New Prices

- Check if new prices were implemented on October 10, 2017

```{r datacheck4, eval = F}
kable(price_check, align = "c",
    col.names = c("Product ID", 
                  "Description", 
                  "Data - before Oct 10", 
                  "Data - after Oct 10", 
                  "Ref - before Oct 10", 
                  "Ref - after Oct 10")) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped")) %>%
  column_spec(5:6, background = "darkgray")
```

---

# Data Checks - New Prices

- Check if new prices were implemented on October 10, 2017

```{r kable, echo = F}
kbl(price_check, align = "c",
    col.names = c("Product ID", "Description", "Data - before Oct 10", "Data - after Oct 10", "Ref - before Oct 10", "Ref - after Oct 10")) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped")) %>%
  column_spec(5:6, background = "darkgray")
```

---

# Joins

- In the Excel workshop, you used the VLOOKUP function to bring in the product, service, and payment type descriptions in the Reference sheet to the Transaction sheet. 

- In R, we use the `*_join()` functions to merge different data frames.

---

# Joins

- To join data frames in R, we need to tell R 
  1. The data frames we want to merge, and 
  2. The variable/s to merge by
  
```{r joins}
pay_codes <- pay_codes %>%
  rename(payment_type = cr_visa)

transaction <- transaction %>%
  full_join(prod_codes %>% select(product_id, description, category),  #<< 
            by = c("product_id")) %>% #<< 
  rename(prod_description = description) %>%
  full_join(serv_codes, by = c("service_id")) %>%
  rename(serv_description = description) %>%
  full_join(pay_codes, by = c("payment_type"))
```

---

# Pivot Tables with {dplyr}

- Pivot tables in Excel allows us to summarize data in different ways. 
- Let's recreate one pivot table you created during the Excel workshop.

```{r, out.width="200px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/pivottable.png")
```

---

# Pivot Tables with {dplyr}

- In Excel, we filtered the data to only show `Years = 2019`, grouped by `Product Category` and `Month`, and then summarized by `Units` and `Subtotal`
- We create the functions of pivot tables in R by the same  logic. 
- In code: 

```{r pivot_show, eval = F}
data %>% 
  filter() %>%
  group_by() %>%
  summarize() %>%
```

- The code reads: Take the data, filter by something, and then group by something, and then summarize by something.

  group_by(category, month) %>%
  summarize(total_units = sum(units) ,
            total_subtotal = sum(subtotal))
```

Code for formatted table

# Oh no, they sent you the wrong data! 

- After doing all the work, your colleague said they missed a few transactions and sent you a new file called `Crepe & Mocca Database workshop PRE v2.xlsx`. 

- If you were doing this report in Excel, it would be a bummer because you'd have to do our checks, create the variables, rebuild the pivot tables, and export figures into the report again. 

- Since you did it in R, we are in a better position because of automation and reproducibility.

- You will have to go back to the top of your script and load in the new Excel file instead and run your codes or re-knit.
